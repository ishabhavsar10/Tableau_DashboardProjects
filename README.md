# Tableau_DashboardProjects
These two Tableau dashboards are designed to provide clear and actionable insights for business users, even those without a data background. The Manufacturing Analysis Dashboard helps a manufacturing company by visualizing key performance metrics such as production output, costs, and quality control. At the same time, the Zomato Project Dashboard gives a restaurant chain a deep dive into its sales, customer trends, and operational performance. Both dashboards are built to be user-friendly, using clean designs and easy-to-read charts so managers and team members can quickly make data-driven decisions.
